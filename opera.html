        <h4>The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan
            The 14 Gilbert And Sullivan Plays</h4>
        <h5>ACT II</h5>
        
        <h5>
            SCENE-the same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place
            of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage, the
            interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background
            of the scene of Act I, through the columns of the portico at the
            back. High throne. L.U.E. Low seats below it.  All the substitute
            gods and goddesses [that is to say, Thespians] are discovered
            grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage, eating and
            drinking, and smoking and singing the following verses.
        </h5>

        <h6>THES.</h6> <p>Oh, only once a year?</p>

        <h6>MER.</h6> <p>Only once a year—</p>
        
        <h6>THES.</h6> <p>And the year is up?</p> 

        <h6>MER.</h6> <p>Today.</p>

        <h6>THES.</h6> <p>Oh, then I suppose there are some complaints?</p>

        <h6>MER.</h6> <p>Yes, there are some.</p> 

        <h6>THES.</h6> <p> <p>[Disturbed]</p> Oh, perhaps there are a good many?</p> 

        <h6>MER.</h6> <p>There are a good many.</p>

        <h6>THES.</h6> <p>Oh, perhaps there are a thundering lot?</p>

        <h6>MER.</h6> <p>There are a thundering lot.</p> 

        <h6>THES.</h6> <p>[very much disturbed]</p> <p> Oh.</p> 

        <h6>MER.</h6> <p> You see you've been taking it so very easy—and so have most of your company.</p>

        <h6>THES.</h6> <p>Oh, who has been taking it easy?</p>

        <h6>MER.</h6> <p>Well, all except those who have been trying experiments.</p>
